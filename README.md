# Vanity âˆž
Re-designing Vanity. Again.

**Vanity enables you to create wonderfully useful documentation for your projects.** Designed from the ground-up to support templates and all sorts of other customizations, Vanity makes it easy for any developer to provide a world-class documentation experience for their customers.

Vanity supports a complete documentation experience, and supports the generation of an API reference, user guides, cookbooks & tutorials, screencasts and more! Vanity also supports full-text search of all of your documentation content.
